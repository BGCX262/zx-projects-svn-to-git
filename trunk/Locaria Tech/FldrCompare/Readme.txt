Q: What is the purpose of this program?
A: This program is designed to compare the size between 2 different folders and its last modified date.

Q: How different is it from Windows Shell's right-click properties?
A: This program reads the contents of a folder with a different algorithm then Windows'.

Q: Is there a limit to the size of a folder I can compare?
A: As of 1.0.0.7, the 32GB limitation has been removed and is virtually infinite (no limitation). The larger the folder, the longer it will take however.

Q: I just analyzed a large folder and want to re-analyze it again, the speed is the same as before, shouldn't it be faster?
A: As explained above, this program uses a different algorithm to read the contents of a folder, therefore it does not keep the analysis in memory like windows does.

Q: Why are some of my programs laggy when a comparison is in progress?
A: Again, the algorithm of this program differs from windows' so some CPU Usage is required to analyze large folders, which causes causing temporary lag.

Q: Can I use this program to compare a network folder/location?
A: No, this program is not designed to read the contents of a network folder/location. Doing so will cause the program to loop infinitely until it runs out of memory.

Q: Why can't I analyze my library on Windows 7? It keeps saying that the path is invalid!
A: This program is not designed to read the contents of a root library as it is unable to locate the library's CLSID. It is however able to read the contents of a sub-folder of that library.

Q: My computer crashes/blue screen after I clicked the Compare button! What happened?
A: Your motherboard or processor(s) may not support the algorithm used by the program.

Q: What is Window Spy and why is in this program?
A: It is just a debug feature included in the coding of the program which was formerly used to detect the active window's ID. It is no longer used though the code is left there. There is nothing to worry about as it DOES NOT "spy" on your information, I guarantee your safety.

Q: Is this program open-source?
A: It is, however I did not include the source code due to security and privacy reasons. You are free to request the source code from me though and I might consider sending it to you.

Q: Where can I obtain updates for this program?
A: I currently in progress on making a new website to hold my programs, in the meantime you are free to contact my at facebook dot com slash haseoyandols.
