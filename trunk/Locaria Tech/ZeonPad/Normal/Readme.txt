# When making your own keymaps, you must remember to bind ALL buttons to a key!!
There must not be any blank keymaps in your keymap file, otherwise you will get an error from the program.
If a button is not used in a game, bind it to a key that is not used in the game.

# The DPad cannot be configured as the axis is predefined automatically by your windows settings.

# This program only supports controllers/joysticks that have a maximum of 10 buttons, not including the DPad.

# Analog is not supported at this time.

# Use the tester tool to find out what number each of your controller's button is.
